# Useful Guns
Useful Guns adds a few types of guns to the game as well as a ton of bullets to shoot with, along with a bag to store all the ammo and related tools.

## Features
- `Tipped Bullets` that functions like `Tipped Arrows`
- `Splash Bullets` and `Lingering Bullets` like their Potion counterparts
- Bullets that can mine an area of blocks depending on the kind of gun that it was shot from
- 7 sizes of ammo bags but you're limited up to 12 unique ammo types
- A Radial Menu that you can select bullets from the first ammo bag in your inventory
- Several kinds of bullets like `Armor Piercing`, `BuckShot`, `Explosive Bullet`, and much more

## Future Plans
- Add more guns
- Add guns but with swords on them
- Add enchantments that can buff the firepower of guns
